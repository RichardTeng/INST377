<h1>Not Sure What I Am Doing</h1>
<p>This is supposed to be a paragraph?</p>

<h2>So this is a heading that is not as important</h2>
<p>And this is some other random paragraph that I needed to type</p>
<p>Below is a link to the website that all UMD students need to use</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/"><button>Click me if you are UMD student</button></a>
<p>Yes I just flexed a button that is a link<p>
<p>Hopefully the link above works</p>

<h2>And this is showing you that I can make lists</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Eat</li>
	<li>Sleep</li>
	<li>Hopefully Study</li>
	<li>Workout</li>
</ol>
